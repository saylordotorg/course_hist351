**Unit 4: The Expansion of Islam into Europe** <span id="4"></span> 
*When a Shi’a leader—Abu al-Abbas—usurped power from the reigning Sunni
caliph in 750 C.E., the Umayyad era officially came to a close.  While
al-Abbas tried to execute all members of the Sunni Umayyads, one leader
escaped to the Iberian Peninsula, where he established a new Umayyad
kingdom.  However, Abd ar-Rahman I was not the first Muslim to invade
Spain; Muslim Berbers had overthrown the Visigoths and established the
kingdom of Al-Andalus in the early eighth century.  Still, the Umayyads
in Spain—known as the Caliphate of Cordoba—retained power until the
1000s.  With the decline of the Caliphate, several smaller kingdoms,
called “taifas,” claimed control over southern Spain.  It was not until
1492, when the Christian monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella declared a holy
war against the Spanish Muslims did Muslim control of the region come to
an end.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will study the emergence of a new Umayyad imperium in
southern Spain in the 700s. We will also examine the decline of the
Umayyad caliphate and the rise of independent Berber kingdoms that
became locked in conflict with Christian Spain.*
