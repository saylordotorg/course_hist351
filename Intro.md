Course Syllabus for "HIST351: Islam, The Middle East, and The West"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to the history of the Middle East from
the rise of Islam to the twenty-first century.  The course will
emphasize the encounters and exchanges between the Islamic world and the
West.  It will be structured chronologically—each unit will focus on the
emergence of a particular Middle Eastern society or empire during a
specific time period.  Each unit will include representative
primary-source documents that illustrate important overarching
political, economic, and social themes, such as the emergence of Islam
in the seventh century, conflicts between Islamic and Christian peoples
during the Crusades, European domination of Muslim territories in the
nineteenth century, independence movements and the rise of nationalism
in the 1900s, and the formation of Islamic fundamentalist groups and
anti-Western sentiment in the latter twentieth century.  By the end of
the course, you will understand how Islam became a sophisticated and
far-reaching civilization and how conflicts with the West shaped the
development of the Middle East from the medieval period to the present
day.
