**Unit 9: The Islamic World in an Age of European Domination** <span
id="9"></span> 
*The collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the end of World War I, and the
discovery of oil allowed European powers to gain new influence in the
Middle East.  Near the end of World War I, Britain and France negotiated
for the partition of the Middle East between them, proclaiming
territorial “mandates.”  In addition, Britain promised European Zionists
a Jewish homeland in Palestine.  Not only were Britain and France
interested in expanding their influence in the Middle East, but they
were keen on exploiting the Middle East’s primary resource: oil.  Oil
fueled the development of industrial Europe, and by mandating control
over Middle Eastern countries, Britain and France were guaranteed access
to sought-after petroleum products.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will consider the how and why territorial mandates and
protectorates under the authority of European powers were established in
the Middle East.  We will also study how these policies ignited conflict
among Islamic peoples, especially in Palestine.*
