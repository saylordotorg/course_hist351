**Unit 1: Islamic Civilization** <span id="1"></span> 
*Islam first arrived on the Arabian Peninsula in the seventh century. 
But before its appearance, the tribal societies living on the Arabian
Peninsula—the Bedouin—embraced polytheistic or animistic religious
beliefs.  Bedouin clans, the nomadic societies built around goat and
camel herding, populated the desert.  Towns and cities, including Mecca,
were dependent upon alliances with the neighboring Bedouin tribes.  When
Muhammad began preaching his “revelations” in the 600s, he encountered
hostility and criticism from many Arab communities.  However, the
Bedouin eventually became enthusiastic converts to Islam—a
universalizing faith that united disparate Arab tribes.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will study the culture and religion of the Bedouin
tribes of Arabia.  We will then examine the effects that Muhammad’s
conversion efforts had among the Bedouin in the seventh century.*

    (“Introduction,” “The Poem of Imru-ul-Quais,” “The Poem of Antar,”
    and “The Poem of Zuhair”); these poems will serve as excellent
    introductions to pre-Islamic Arab poetry.  
        
     Note on the text:  The emergence of Islam in the seventh century
    meant that the Arabic language replaced many ethnic languages and
    regional dialects across the Middle East.  However, while the
    Islamic text of the Qur’an is thought to be one of the first texts
    written in Arabic, many examples of Arabic literature predated it. 
    The “hanged poems,” for example, covered the walls of the “ka-aba,”
    or cubic temple in Mecca, before the establishment of a widespread
    Muslim order.
