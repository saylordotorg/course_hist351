**Unit 11: The Islamic Revolution, Terrorism, and the West** <span
id="11"></span> 
*The Islamic Revolution of 1979 (also known as the Iranian Revolution)
overthrew the reigning shah (king) and established a theocratic state. 
The leader of the revolt, a Shi’ite Muslim cleric, proclaimed himself
Ayatollah—or “supreme leader”—of Iran.  The Ayatollah asserted the
importance of the Islamic faith and decried Western influence and
policy.  The revolution established an important precedent in the Middle
East by encouraging the proliferation of an Islamic ideology throughout
the region.  As a result, in the 1980s and 1990s, many fundamentalist
Muslim groups emerged, including Al Qaeda and the Taliban.  Many of
these groups embraced an extreme strain of Islam as well as violent
anti-Western sentiment.  Islamic fundamentalists were responsible for
numerous terrorist attacks against Western powers, including the 1998
embassy bombings in Africa and the September 11, 2001 attacks in New
York City.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider the emergence of an Islamic ideology
grounded in anti-Western sentiment that began to unite the Muslim world
in the 1980s.  We will also study the manifestation of that ideology in
its most extreme form: Islamic terrorist groups.*
