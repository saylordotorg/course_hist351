**Unit 2: Islamic Society and Faith** <span id="2"></span> 
*Islam became an established religion in the Middle East after the death
of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 C.E.  Although Muhammad originally worked
as a merchant in Mecca, he soon became disenchanted with society and
retreated to a cave for meditation.  It was there, at the age of 40,
that Muhammad began to receive his first revelations from God.  These
revelations formed the basis of the Qur’an—the main religious text on
which the Islamic faith is based.  Muhammad began preaching his
revelations to the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula; although he met with
initial hostility, many of the tribes had converted to Islam by the time
of Muhammad’s death.  His successors—the “four rightly guided
caliphs”—continued conversion efforts during the Umayyad dynasty. 
Muslims consider Muhammad’s revelations to be the true word of God
(Allah).  These revelations form the basis of Islamic law, religious
practices, and philosophy.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider the historical context surrounding the
emergence of Islam in Arabia.  We will also study how Islam became a
widely embraced religion that formed the basis of society in the Middle
East.  *
