**Unit 3: Arab Conquests and the Rise of the Caliphate** <span
id="3"></span> 
*After being united under the aegis of Islam, the Arabs—known as the
Umayyads—began military campaigns outside of their realm.  In the
mid-seventh century, Muslim armies began invading parts of the
increasingly vulnerable Sassanid and Byzantine empires, claiming land in
what is now Egypt, Syria, and Palestine.  In fact, so powerful were the
Islamic army and navy that Byzantium was permanently crippled by the
invasions.  The Umayyads went on to conquer northern Africa and invade
India, building a kingdom that exceeded the size of the Roman Empire. 
But despite their success abroad, the Umayyads suffered a period of
discord at home: a succession dispute resulted in a division of Muslims
into Sunni and Shi’a factions.  While the Sunnis retained temporary
control of the caliphate, a Shi’ite uprising in 750 C.E. toppled the
Umayyads and established Abbasid rule.  Under the Abbasids, mass
conversion to Islam was encouraged, as was a dynamic Afro-Eurasian trade
network.  The Abbasids also established Persian as the official
language, and encouraged the flowering of Islamic culture.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will study how the unity of the Arab world under Islam
allowed for the expansion of the Umayyad Empire in the 600s.  We will
also consider the causes for the Sunni-Shi’a split and the emergence of
the Abbasid dynasty.*
