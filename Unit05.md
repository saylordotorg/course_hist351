**Unit 5: The Crusades** <span id="5"></span> 
*The Crusades—a series of religious wars launched to restore Christian
control of the Holy Land—began in 1096 and were the most conspicuous
sign of the rise and expansion of Christian Europe.  The first crusade
resulted in the division of Syria and Palestine into smaller Christian
kingdoms, although subsequent crusades had less successful outcomes. 
Under the Muslim ruler Saladin, most of the Holy Land was reclaimed for
Islam by the late 1100s; by 1251, Muslim armies had expelled all
Christian kingdoms.  The impact of the Crusades was twofold: first, they
established a precedent for the rift between Western Christendom and the
Middle Eastern Muslim world and second, they intensified commercial
contact between the two regions.  While Europeans were interested in
obtaining textiles, scientific knowledge, and medicine from the Muslim
world, Muslims had little interest in European goods or culture.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will examine the causes and effects of the European
claim to the Muslim-dominated Holy Land.  We will also study the impact
of the Crusades, which led to the fall of Byzantium and increased
anti-Muslim sentiment in Christian Europe.*
