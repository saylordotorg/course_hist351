**Unit 10: Nationalism and Independence Movements** <span
id="10"></span> 
*Beginning in 1940s, Britain and France abandoned their protectorates
and ended their mandates in the Middle East, largely due to conflicts
that erupted between local governments and their foreign occupiers. 
Between 1941 and 1947, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt
(with the exception of the British-dominated Suez Canal) became
independent of European rule.  And in 1948, Zionists established the
state of Israel, a declaration that precipitated the 1948 Arab-Israeli
war and decades of subsequent conflict.  However, while many Middle
Eastern nations became independent of British and French rule in the
1940s, the onset of the Cold War attracted new foreign interest in the
region.  As a result, the United States and the Soviet Union vied for
control of the Middle East throughout much of the twentieth century.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine how Middle Eastern independence
movements and nationalism resulted in the creation of several new states
in the region.  We will also study how the end of British and French
occupation of the Middle East also meant the beginning of Soviet and
American influence there.*

    protecting them from Communist Russia.
