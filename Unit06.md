**Unit 6: The Mongol Invasions** <span id="6"></span> 
*The Mongols—nomads of central Eurasia—dominated world history during
the thirteenth century.  The Mongols invaded many postclassical empires
and built an extensive cultural and commercial network.  Led by Chinggis
Khan and his successors, the Mongols brought China, Persia, Tibet,
Eurasia Minor, and southern Russia under their control.  The Mongol
Empire also opened trade routes—primarily along the Silk Road—as well as
lines of communication between Asia and the Middle East.  Under Hulegu
Khan, the Mongols sacked the Abbasid capital at Baghdad and decimated
much of the Islamic civilization.  They killed the last Abbasid
caliphate and established the Ilkhanate, which ruled Persia until the
fourteenth century.  The Ilkhans embraced many religions, particularly
Christianity, in their quest to create an alliance with Europe. 
However, beginning in 1295, the Ilkhans converted to Islam.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will study the end of the Abbasid era and the invasion
of the Mongols.  We will also examine the effect of Buddhist and
Christian Mongol rule over predominantly Muslim peoples.*
