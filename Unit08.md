**Unit 8: European Challenges and the Ottoman Empire** <span
id="8"></span> 
*By the nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire was in decline.  The
Ottomans, their imperial holdings much reduced since their heyday in the
sixteenth century, became increasingly dependent on European resources
to buoy their empire.  Beginning in the late 1800s, Ottoman leaders
embarked upon a policy of reform that they believed would modernize
their state by implementing constitutional government, educational
systems, new technology, and new industry with European monies.  As a
result of this financial dependence, many European powers began to
dominate or annex Ottoman holdings in the Middle East in the 1800s. 
With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Ottomans allied themselves
with the Central Powers—Austria-Hungary and Germany—but were defeated by
the Allied forces in 1918. *  
 *             
 In this unit, we will study the reasons for the decline of the Ottoman
Empire in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  We will also examine
how and why European nations challenged Ottoman authority and began to
exert power in the Middle East.*
