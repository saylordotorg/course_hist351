**Unit 7: The Ottomans and the Safavids** <span id="7"></span> 
*Two powerful Muslim empires emerged in the Middle East in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.  The Ottomans ruled Asia Minor,
eastern Europe, northern Africa, and parts of the Middle East, while the
Safavids built an empire that included present-day Afghanistan and
Iran.  Both, however, possessed a religious zeal for the expansion of
Islam.  The Ottomans emerged in the wake of Mongol defeat: they invaded
the Balkans, captured Constantinople, and toppled Byzantium, forging a
military state ruled by a sultanate and dominated by a warrior
aristocracy.  The Safavids also rose to power in the wake of the Mongol
invasions.  The Safavids were Shi’a Muslims who claimed leadership and
established rule by a shah and his court.  Both the Ottomans and the
Safavids encouraged Islamic learning and cultural advancement while also
bolstering trade.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider emergence of the Ottoman and Safavid
empires.  We will compare and contrast the two empires and study the
reasons for their hegemony and decline.*
